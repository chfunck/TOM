Toolbox for OMEN in MATLAB

TOM was designed to make simulations of Quantum Dot (QD) structures with OMEN easier and more efficient from a user's perspective. 

Contents:
GUI for simple and efficient starting of OMEN simulations for QD structures.
GUI for managing simulation data and accessing some of the possible visualisation tools
Functions for visualisation of simulation data, in particular of the eigenenergies and eigenfunctions.
